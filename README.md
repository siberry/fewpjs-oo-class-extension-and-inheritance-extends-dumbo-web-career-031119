# Class Extensions and Inheritance: `extends`

## Learning Goals

- Use the `extends` keyword

## Introduction

In JavaScript, as in other Object Oriented languages, we've learned
that we can create classes and build methods that can perform
actions on instance data, or specific to the class. What if you have
classes that exhibit many of the same behaviors, such as `Cat`, `Dog`,
and `Bird`, which all have a method for `speak`?

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    return `${this.name} says woof!`
  }
}

class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    return `${this.name} says meow!`
  }
}

class Bird {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
      return `${this.name} says squawk!`
    }
  }
```
In this code snippet, `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird` all accept `name` and
have a method called `speak()`, thus repeating code. In JavaScript,
we can create "child" object classes that inherit methods and properties
from their "parent" classes, allowing us to reuse some class methods while
building in additional functionality.

In this lesson, we'll discuss 1 way of _extending_ functionality to
other classes.

## Use the `extends` Keyword

To get started with inheriting class functionality, we utilize the `extends`
keyword. `extends` is used in class declarations to create a class which
is a _child_ of another class.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name, sound) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  speak() {
    return `${this.name} says ${this.sound}!`
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  // inherits constructor from Pet
}

class Cat extends Pet {
  // inherits constructor from Pet
}

class Bird extends Pet  {
  // inherits constructor from Pet
  fly() {
    return `${this.name} flies away!`
  }
}

let dog = new Dog("Shadow", "woof");
let cat = new Cat("Missy", "meow");
let bird = new Bird("Tiki", "squawk");

dog.speak(); // Shadow says woof!
cat.speak(); // Missy says meow!
bird.speak(); // Tiki says squawk!
bird.fly(); // Tiki flies away!
```

In addition to _inheriting_ the functionality of the `Pet` class, each "child"
class extending the functionality of the parent. For example, `Bird` has an
additional method called `fly` that is unique to it, and not present on `Pet`.
`Bird` can still call `speak()`.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about more functionality in JavaScript that allows
us to leverage Object Orientation concepts: class extensions and inheritance.
With `extends` we can create new classes that are capable of utilizing all the
same methods as its parent. Leveraging inheritance and `extends` is vital in
Object Oriented programming. It keeps code bases maintainable by sharing and
reusing code in a beneficial manner.
